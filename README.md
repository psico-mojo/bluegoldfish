all browsers tested and working are ; chromium ; brave;chrome;firefox;

they can also be sent as email attachments that can be reactvated by the recipient . i.e "run on the recievers desktop" 

transferred from one desktop to another any where on the www. by clicking "open on desktop" when choosing to downlaod the "attachment"

you can employ a "file scanner " first to ensure no malicious code is entering your environment ,which is immposible since the files are created as type "indelible"

along with the icon creation which is "burned into the code as a 64bit datafile . 

Once the file is created , the code is "obfuscated" , since the actual "app.code" contained within the ICON is contained on a remote server so it would be impossible for 


#Windows desktop
